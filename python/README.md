# aquarius-sdk

The Python SDK for [Aquarius](https://aqua.network) — swaps, liquidity, and rewards on Stellar.

**Status: 0.1.x — the swap surface is complete and verified with real testnet swaps.** Pools, liquidity, and rewards arrive in 0.2. The API may still change before 1.0.

```bash
pip install aquarius-sdk
```

```python
from stellar_sdk import Keypair
from aquarius import AquariusClient, Asset, XLM, SlippageError

AQUA = Asset.classic("AQUA", "GBNZ...AQUA")

aqua = AquariusClient(network="mainnet", signer=Keypair.from_secret(secret))

# exact input: quote, inspect, execute
quote = aqua.quote(XLM, AQUA, amount_in=100_0000000, slippage=0.01)
receipt = quote.execute()

# exact output: pass amount_out instead — strict-receive throughout
quote = aqua.quote(XLM, AQUA, amount_out=500_0000000)
```

## What the SDK handles for you

- **Routing** — quotes come from the find-path API; the swap chain XDR is passed through untouched.
- **Transaction lifecycle** — simulation, assembly, submission with congestion retries (same-hash resubmission with backoff), and confirmation polling.
- **Archived state** — if simulation reports expired ledger entries, the SDK restores them (one extra signed transaction) and retries automatically.
- **Typed errors** — `SlippageError` (with `requote()`), `PausedError` (kill switches — not your bug), `NoRouteError`, `UserRejectedError`, `TxTimeoutError`.

## Signers

A stellar-sdk `Keypair` works as-is. Custom signers provide `public_key` plus `sign(tx_xdr) -> str` returning the signed envelope XDR. Reads — `quote()` — need no signer at all.

## Escape hatches

`quote.build_transaction()` returns the simulated, unsigned envelope XDR for external signing flows. `client.contract_call(fn, *scvals)` invokes the router raw. `client.api` is the typed REST client.

## Amounts

All amounts are integers in token base units (stroops for classic assets: 1 token = 10^7).
